# Data science environment 
Hello! I hope you're doing great.
This is my new personal space to work in data science, this repository is intended to save my progress on learning about this beatiful topic, the personal projects I manage to develop throughout my carreer, and useful discoverments!

## Content
- The first thing you'll find here is my **machine_learning** file, which name interpretation in my opinion is **Â¡I'm learning how to make machines learn!**.
  This folder will save my personal learning-roadmap whereas I keep on learning new things. Here you can find a structured path through different Python notebooks provided by Microsoft that will help you to understand this beatiful topic from scratch.
