# Data Analytics
We first have to understand that data analysis and data analytics is not the same.
Data analytics comprehends the science of data. We can understand data analytics as an umbrella that covers the whole **data** subject, whereas data analysis tries to answer existing questions about data, and transform those answers into insights that support **data-driven** decisions and strategies.
Normally, these decisions and strategies are validated with subject matter experts, who are aware of the bussiness processes and can verify whether a decision makes sense or not.

As a Data Analyst, you have the ability to empower businesses to incorporate **data-driven** culture, and so, you are supossed to:
- **Ask:** Make useful and relevant question that can help you to either understand the problem you're facing or find actual ways to dive into available data and information.
- **Prepare:** Once you've asked relevant questions about the problem you're trying to face using data analysis, collection and storage of that data should be defined here.
- **Process:** It involves every necesarry process that allows us as analysts to clean our data and so, make it meaningful
- **Analyze:** Using tools such as Python, R, Tableau and SQL, are you able to find any behaviour in the data you're processing so far? What are your conclusions?
- **Share:** It involves being effective when showing those insights to the stakeholders involved in the project you're working for.
- **Act:** Although we do have to analyze data using technical skills, action and collaboration with different areas depending on the project we're working on is actually the most important part of the work. This is the moment when decisions are made and become data-driven.
