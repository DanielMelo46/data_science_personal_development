# Data Analytics
As a Data Analyst, you are supossed to:
- **Ask:** Make useful and relevant question that can help you to either understand the problem you're facing or find actual ways to dive into available data and information.
- **Prepare:** Once you've asked relevant questions about the problem you're trying to face using data analysis, collection and storage of that data should be defined here.
- **Process:** It involves every necesarry process that allows us as analysts to clean our data and so, make it meaningful
- **Analyze:** Using tools such as Python, R, Tableau and SQL, are you able to find any behaviour in the data you're processing so far? What are your conclusions?
- **Share:** It involves being effective when showing those insights to the stakeholders involved in the project you're working for.
- **Act:** Although we do have to analyze data using technical skills, action and collaboration with different areas depending on the project we're working on is actually the most important part of the work. This is the moment decisions are made and become data-driven.
